# my nixos configurations

- using NixOS, Nix-Flakes and Home Manager

- modularity as a core structure

- working on nixvim, basic implementation done

## missing implementations - 
- zsh
- any window managers at all

## long term
- make this configuration reproducible
- create install script for easy adoptability on any system with nix installed
